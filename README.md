The flag was sliced into three pieces and wrapped in escalating layers of ciphers. Each slice has one more layer than the last.

**Goal:** Recover each slice and submit the final flag as:


CTF{FLAG1_FLAG2_FLAG3}

Each part was encrypted with 1, 2, and 3 simple classic transformations. Work backwards from the text to find the flag


### Layer 1
6d70797a617a73706a6c

### Layer 2
OiYmJi0hOi8sKiY=


### Layer 3
R1VWRVFGWVZQUg==



Good luck peeling back the layers! ðŸ§…
